    "    * Abrreviated and Incomplete street names\n",

    "### Abrreviated, Incorrect and Incomplete street names\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through the  results of  \"Audit.ipynb\" code, it was seen that some of the street name were abbreviated some were incorrect and some others were incomplete. The abrreviated one included 'Ave' for 'Avenue', 'Rd', 'Rd.'for 'Road' and 'st' for 'Street'. There was one incorrect street name where 'Extention' was used instead of  'Extension'. A few street names  were incomplete like simply stating 'Monkstown' for 'Monkstown Road'. The incomplete street names were a little hard to correct as I had to google these street names and findout the correct names. The following mapping dictionary and update_name() were used to correct the data before exporting to SQL.\n",

    "Script should be written to check and correct the OpenStreetMaps data automatically, this code should be monitored and improvements should be made to the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem for the implementation is that since the data is being entered by different users, for set of good scripts to evolve it will take a lot of time. \n",
